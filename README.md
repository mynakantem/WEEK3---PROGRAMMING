Overview:
Week 3 was dedicated to learning fundamental data structures and algorithms critical to programming efficiency and performance.
We explored linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash maps, implemented key searching and sorting algorithms, and handled file input/output using various Java classes. 
Additionally, we introduced the concepts of algorithm runtime analysis and Big-O notation to evaluate algorithm efficiency.
